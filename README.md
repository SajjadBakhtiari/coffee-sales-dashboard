## Dashboard Insights

1. **Monthly Sales Revenue**  
   - Series 3 consistently contributed the largest share of revenue.  
   - Sales dips in Series 1 and 2 were mainly caused by **stock-outs and delayed replenishment**, not reduced demand.  

2. **Average Profit Margin by Package Size**  
   - Smaller packages (80g, 150g) generally yielded higher profit margins.  
   - Larger packages (4000g) had thinner margins but were important for bulk buyers and market share.  

3. **Sales Weight by Series**  
   - Series 3 accounted for the largest sales volume.  
   - Series 2 contributed less in volume but remained significant in revenue due to higher pricing.  
   - Series 1 represented a very small share in weight but a high unit value.

## Key Insights

- **Series 3** is the backbone of sales and should remain the primary focus for marketing and distribution.  
- **Series 2** plays an essential role in profitability despite lower volumes; ensuring stock availability is critical.  
- **Series 1** enhances the companyâ€™s brand image and presence in the premium market segment.  
- Sales declines in certain months were directly tied to **inventory shortages** rather than falling customer demand.
